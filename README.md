Priyadharshini | AI & Software Developer

Innovating with AI, Building with Code, Designing with Precision

I am a results-driven AI & Software Developer with expertise in large language models (LLMs), automation, UI/UX design, and backend development. With a strong background in Python, AI, and cloud-based deployments, I specialize in building intelligent applications that enhance automation and user experience.

Currently, at Ray-i Systems, I am developing AI-driven solutions, including an SOQ Automator using LLMs deployed on AWS and an AI Companion App for interactive conversations. I have also built Kivy-based UI components for LiDAR-powered truck volume evaluation.

Previously, as a Python Developer at Tenthplanet Technologies, I designed and implemented RESTful APIs, optimized SQL queries, and contributed to Agile development processes, ensuring seamless backend-to-frontend communication. My early experience as a Customer Support Officer at Allsec Technologies helped me develop strong problem-solving and client interaction skills.

With a passion for AI, automation, and intuitive software design, I thrive on solving complex challenges and delivering scalable, efficient solutions.
